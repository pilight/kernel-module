kernel-module
=============

pilight kernel module with software band-pass filtering and command recognition.
watch out! compiling directly on the raspberry can give some wired errors!! crosscompiling is suggested!

config options:
==============
	debug=1 			//enables debuging mode
	pulse_tollerance= 	//value in us to adapt for some protocolls (5us is standard and works good for me)
